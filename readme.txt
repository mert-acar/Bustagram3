-Description-
The project is aimed to track the Bilkent busses for students and staff.

Attached, you can find the code for a basis of an android application with a selected item method 
for selecting the bus on the dropdown menu. Additionally, the basic menu for the Bustagram with 
map marker. The location services are yet to be explored and written.

Ege Özcan

I worked on the online and the offline dropdown menu 
with Simge. We tried to implement the onItemListener 
to our dropdown menu to make the app show the bus schedule 
for the given bus. We faced some problems along the way, 
we were able to overcome most but some still remain.

Zeynep Gözel

I searched server implementation for android applications. 
We are planning to get user information such as velocity, 
acceleration and location. Then, we will collect all these 
information in our server and use all datas to get an accurate
 results. However, using a server requires mySql and PHP 
knowledge so we will collect data in a domain.

Simge Tabak

I worked with Ege on "onItemSelected" method. 
We dealt with some of the errors but could not find 
out how to get rid of the last one.

Dilara Halavurt

I worked on the NFC technology use and the ways to 
code NFC tags to signal the availability of the data use.

Mert Acar

I worked with Murat to create the navigation drawer of 
the application and created the steps of setting, about us, 
and added the marker to the map. Next step is to add the map to the
application and solce the problems of updating the map continuously.

Murat Tüver

I and Mert designed some parts of the Main_Activity. 
Which are adding a navigation drawer, task bar and showing
 users location. Next step is to implement a database - 
or an ArrayList in a domain- to process data and send 
processed data back to users to show users where buses are.
